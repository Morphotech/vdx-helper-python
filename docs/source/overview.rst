Overview
===========

The VDX Core API is a REST API that provides developers with a simple-to-use interface to several Blockchains for the
purpose of issuing Blockchain verifiable credentials. If you want to integrate the VDX Core API into your own Python
project, then the vdx-helper library is the easiest way to do so.

Read more about the `API <https://docs.vizidox.com>`__ itself to understand each endpoint and how to issue your files.
